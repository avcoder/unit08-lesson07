# Recap

- lab tmrw
- fyi: next week Tues
1. To deploy to stores, Get a developer account:
   - Apple: $99 per year
   - Google: one time fee $25
   - business account: must provide proof
   - individual account: if you charge for your app, your personal address will be made public
- Recommendation: if you charge for your app (or even in-app purchases) use business account so you can use a PO box for your address
- Difference: Must pay $25 to Google when ready to deploy to stores vs Must pay $99 to Apple just to generate certificates to run on physical device
2. Deploy to App Store either via: Xcode, Transporter app, `eas submit` > creates app on App Store Connect
  - and/or Upload to Google Play Console, along with screenshots

# Splash screen

- Once you are using a developing build and not Expo Go, you can now customize the splash screen and app icon.  All we need to do is configure the updated assets in app.json, prebuild, rebuild.
- Can create app icon via tools like Figma etc. but need to be a specific size
  - see https://www.figma.com/community/file/1155362909441341285/expo-app-icon-splash
- Splash screen must be `1284 x 2778` which will be displayed when app first launches
  - Replace existing `assets/splash.png` with your new Figma one
- App icon in iOS: `1024 x 1024` png, no transparency
  - Replace `assets/icon.png`
- App icon in Android `1024 x 1024` png, should have either transparency or solid background
  - Replace `assets/adaptive-icon.png`
- Update app name in package.json under expo > name
- Prebuild via `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` (or replace ios with android)
- Rebuild with `npx expo run:ios` (or replace ios with android)
